 * case, m_freq is irrelevant and set to 0.a

 * Frequency is defined by an integer, which can be:
 * * 1 to denote the S1 DORIS frequency (on 2 GHz), or
 * * 2 to denote the U2 DORIS frequency (on 400 MHz)
 * 
 * @warning m_freq MUST be set to 0, if m_type is one of:
 *          * frequency_offset,
 *          * ground_pressure,
 *          * ground_temperature,
